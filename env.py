    We try type C grid because the performance of various algorithms differs much.
    The style of the grid is a straight line with multiple resistors.
    Each resistor has a base resistance and can double/halve/stay. It has a maximum and minimum resistance.
    This type of circuit has an easy close-form solution to compare with q learning performance.
    The cities are randomly chosen to place at each distributor.
    This environment is also a perfect example to develop meta-reinforcement learning algorithm.

    The state of the global environment is the state of the resistance.
    The local state is
        distributor-distributor: 1) Whether the left voltage increased, lowered or remain the same in last iteration.
                                   (0: remain, 1: decreased, 2: increased)

                          distributor. We add one more state: whether the voltage meet requirement or not.
                          To make the state consistent, we assume a virtual city connected to those which doesn't
                          connect to any cities that always meet the requirement.
        distributor-provider: Whether the voltage at provider is higher or not.
